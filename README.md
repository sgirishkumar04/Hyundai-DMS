## 🌟 Key Features

*   **Multi-Dealer Data Isolation**: Built on a multi-tenant architecture where every showroom's data (Leads, Sales, Service) is strictly isolated using `dealer_id`.
*   **Super Admin Dashboard**: Platform-level control to approve new dealer registrations, monitor network-wide inventory, and manage system roles.
*   **Professional Sales Funnel**: Tracks the entire journey: `Lead → Test Drive → Booking → Allocation → Invoice → Delivery`.
*   **Service Center Operations**: Comprehensive workshop management with Job Cards, Mechanic assignments, and Spare Part usage tracking.
*   **Historical Analytics**: Pre-loaded with 150+ professional historical records (2025-2026) to visualize Year-over-Year (YoY) growth and festive season trends.
*   **Audit Logging**: Every critical action (Created/Updated/Deleted) is logged with the user's name and IP address for full accountability.

## 🚀 Migration & Setup Guide (New Office Laptop)

Follow these 4 steps to set up the project on your new machine.

### 1. Database Initialization
Navigate to `database/laptop/` and run these 4 scripts in order on your MySQL instance:
1.  **[schema.sql](file:///Users/sgirishkumar/Documents/Hyundai-DMS/database/laptop/schema.sql)**: Creates 37 tables, stored procedures, and initial roles.
2.  **[chennai_2025_historical.sql](file:///Users/sgirishkumar/Documents/Hyundai-DMS/database/laptop/chennai_2025_historical.sql)**: Loads 150+ professional records for last year's reports.
3.  **[chennai_insert.sql](file:///Users/sgirishkumar/Documents/Hyundai-DMS/database/laptop/chennai_insert.sql)**: Loads active 2026 showroom data and workshop workload.
4.  **[query.sql](file:///Users/sgirishkumar/Documents/Hyundai-DMS/database/laptop/query.sql)**: Use this as a reference manual for all application queries.

### 2. Backend Setup
1. Open `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`.
2. Update the `spring.datasource.username` and `password` to match your local MySQL credentials.
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

### 3. Frontend Setup
1. Open a terminal in the `frontend/` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Access the app at: `http://localhost:4200`
